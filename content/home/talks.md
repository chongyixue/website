## **T2S-Tensor: Productively Generating High-Performance Spatial Hardware for Dense Tensor Computations**

We present a language and compilation framework for productively generating high-performance systolic arrays for 
dense tensor kernels on spatial architectures, including FPGAs and CGRAs. It decouples a functional specification from a spatial
mapping, allowing programmers to quickly explore various spatial optimizations for the same function. The actual implementation
of these optimizations is left to a compiler. Thus, productivity and performance are achieved at the same time.
