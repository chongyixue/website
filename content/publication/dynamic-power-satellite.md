abstract = "For multi-beam broadband satellites operating at 10 GHz and above frequencies, rain attenuation is the dominant impairment factor. Using a stochastic model for rain attenuation prediction and a greedy approach, dynamic power allocation has been recently shown to increase the number of users served than the static technique. This letter proposes a new dynamic power allocation algorithm the novelty of which lies in treating users with similar power requirement as a group, instead of individuals. Thus, without resorting to exhaustive search we are able to serve more number of users than the existing technique."
